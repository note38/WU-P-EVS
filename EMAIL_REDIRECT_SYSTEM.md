# Email Redirect System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a redirect-based system for handling users whose emails are not registered in the voting system database. Instead of automatically logging them out, users are redirected back to the sign-in page with clear error messages, allowing them to try again with a different email.

## How It Works

### 1. Authentication Flow
1. **User Signs In**: User successfully authenticates with Clerk
2. **Database Check**: System checks if user's email exists in the voting database
3. **Redirect on Error**: If email not found, user is signed out and redirected to sign-in page
4. **Error Display**: Sign-in page shows clear error message
5. **Retry Opportunity**: User can try again with a different email

### 2. Key Components Modified

#### Enhanced useClerkAuth Hook (`/hooks/use-clerk-auth.ts`)
- Detects when user is not found in database (404 response)
- Shows toast notification explaining the issue
- Signs out user after 2-second delay
- Redirects to sign-in page with error parameters

#### Improved API Response (`/app/api/auth/get-user/route.ts`)
- Returns detailed error messages for unregistered emails
- Includes helpful messaging about contacting administrators
- Logs unauthorized access attempts for security monitoring

#### Enhanced Sign-in Page (`/app/sign-in/[[...rest]]/page.tsx`)
- Displays error messages from URL parameters
- Shows persistent alert for email registration issues
- Provides clear instructions for users

### 3. User Experience

#### Error Messages
- **Toast Notification**: \"This email is not registered in our system. Please try with a different email or contact an administrator.\"
- **Persistent Alert**: Shows on sign-in page explaining the email registration requirement
- **Clear Instructions**: Guides users on next steps

#### URL Parameters
- `error=email_not_registered`: Indicates the type of error
- `message=`: Contains the specific error message to display

### 4. Benefits

#### For Users
- **Clear Feedback**: Users understand exactly why they can't access the system
- **Retry Opportunity**: Can immediately try with a different email
- **No Confusion**: Clear instructions on what to do next

#### For Administrators
- **Security Logging**: All unauthorized attempts are logged
- **User Support**: Clear error messages reduce support requests
- **Access Control**: Only registered emails can access the system

## Testing the System

### Test Scenario
1. Navigate to `/sign-in`
2. Sign in with an email that is NOT registered in your voting system database
3. Observe the following sequence:
   - Toast notification appears
   - User is signed out after 2 seconds
   - Redirected to sign-in page
   - Error alert is displayed
   - User can try again with different email

### Expected URL
After redirect: `/sign-in?error=email_not_registered&message=This email is not registered in our system`

## Configuration

The system can be customized by modifying these parameters in the authentication hook:

```typescript
// Delay before redirect (milliseconds)
setTimeout(async () => { ... }, 2000);

// Error message
\"This email is not registered in our system. Please try with a different email or contact an administrator.\"

// Toast notification title
title: \"Access Denied\"
```

## Security Features

- **Access Logging**: All unauthorized access attempts logged
- **Graceful Fallback**: System continues to work even if errors occur
- **Clear Boundaries**: Only registered emails can access protected areas
- **User Education**: Clear messaging about access requirements

This implementation provides a user-friendly way to handle unregistered emails while maintaining security and providing clear feedback to users about why they can't access the system.
